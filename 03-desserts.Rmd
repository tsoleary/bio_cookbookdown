### Pitch

This is classic Brazilian recipe that you see in every kid's birthday party. This year with all the craziness that is happening, my daughter and I have been baking something every week and delivering to the neighbors as a way to stay connected and hoping it will bring a little sweetness to their lives. This recipe has been their favorite so far. It is easy to make and kids can help with the sprinkles. There is also tons of variations you can find online.

### Materials

- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 can sweetened condensed milk
- ¼ cup cocoa powder
- 1 ½ cups chocolate sprinkle, as needed

- makes about 20 servings


### Methods

1. In pot over low heat add sweetened condensed milk, butter and sifted cocoa powder (sifting helps prevent lumps of cocoa powder)
2. Stir continuously (very important as mixture starts getting thicker) until you can tilt the pot and the mixture does not stick to it (or when you can see the bottom of the pot for about 3 seconds after dragging a spatula through)
3. Pour mixture onto a greased plate and let it cool.
4. Divide the mixture into 4 and using butter to grease your hands, shape the mixture into balls (each quarter of the mixture should make about 5 balls)
5. Roll the balls in chocolate sprinkles
6. Enjoy!

## Chocolate Mousse

### Pitch

Do you like eating dessert -- but you are too nervous to bake things because you think you'll screw up the preparation, or the ingredients, or the baking time? Well, let me introduce you to my favorite dessert (and soon to be yours) chocolate mousse - _made straight from the box_! So light. So fluffy. So chocolatey. So delecious. 

Guilt-free dessert -- it's mostly air!

### Story

On my twelfth birthday, when I had learned all there is to learn, a delecious cake aflame infront of me, I said my mom -- respectfully, I hope -- "What's _the big deal_ with cake? It's clearly not the best dessert. Brownies are better. Ice cream is better. Chocolate Mousse is better. People eat cake on birthdays because that is _what you do_, not because it is the best dessert. What's up with that?"

My mom has never let me forget that I said that -- but she has been sure to make chocolate mousse for me every major holiday since.
