It’s been a tradition to gather together and spend a day making batch after batch to share with family and friends. The recipe originally comes from my great Uncle Moe, who passed before I was born and who’s name influenced my name – the “M” in my first name came from his name. 2.2.3 Materials 8 medium potatoes peeled and placed in water 1 lg onion, peeled and finely grated 2 eggs 1 tsp. salt ½ tsp. pepper 1 tbsp. baking powder 1 cup matzo meal or bread crumbs vegetable oil 2.2.4 Methods Grate potatoes with food processor. Mix with grated onion, add eggs, salt, pepper and baking powder. Pour into large bowl, add matzo meal and mix thoroughly. Heat oil, and drop mixture into frying pan. Turn when crisp and drain on brown paper bags. Serve alone or with apple sauce.

This one is a BIG winner. 2.3.2 Materials makes about 12 servings 10 meduim-sized tan-skinned sweet potatoes (~6 lbs), scrubbed (I go by weight) 4 bananas, unpeeled 1 cup butter, room temperature ⅓ cup honey I added some cinnamon and ground cloves 1 ½ cups pecan pieces ¾ cup packed golden brown sugar ½ cup all purpose flour 2.3.3 Methods Preheat oven to 400ºF. Pierce sweet potatoes with fork. Place on rimmed baking sheet or in roasting pan and bake until almost soft, about 40 minutes (I find that this usually takes closer to 60, but it depends on the size of the sweet potatoes). Add bananas to roasting pan alongside sweet potatoes and bake until banana skins brown, about 10 minutes. Let sweet potatoes and bananas stand at room temperature until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes (maintain oven temperature). Cut sweet potatoes in half. Scoop flesh from sweet potatoes into large bowl. Peel bananas; add to bowl. Add ½ cup butter and honey . Beat with wooden spoon until blended and fluffy. Season to taste with salt. Transfer to 8-10 cup ovenproof baking dish. Mix nuts, sugar and flour in bowl. Add ½ cup butter, mix with fingertips until coarse crumbs form (Potatoes and streusel can be made one day ahead). Cover separately; chill. Before continuing, preheat oven to 400ºF. Sprinkle streusel over potatoes. Bake until top is golden brown and potatoes are hot, about 25 minutes. "]]
