Well, let me introduce you to my favorite dessert (and soon to be yours) chocolate mousse - made straight from the box! So light. So fluffy. So chocolatey. So delecious. Guilt-free dessert – it’s mostly air! 2.1.2 Story On my twelfth birthday, when I had learned all there is to learn, a delecious cake aflame infront of me, I said my mom – respectfully, I hope – “What’s the big deal with cake? It’s clearly not the best dessert. Brownies are better. Ice cream is better. Chocolate Mousse is better. People eat cake on birthdays because that is what you do, not because it is the best dessert. What’s up with that?” My mom has never let me forget that I said that – but she has been sure to make chocolate mousse for me every major holiday since. 2.1.3 Materials Box of Chocolate Mousse Mix Likely found in your local grocery store’s pudding isle Milk Bowl Electric mixer 2.1.4 Methods Add contents of the box and one cup of milk to a bowl Beat with the electric mixer on low until thickened Whip at the highest spead for 3 to 5 minutes Spoon into serving dish Chill in the refrigerator for at least an hour Eat! 2.2 Muddy Buddies Hannah Boyd 2.2.1 Pitch If you love crunchy, chocolatey, peanut buttery goodness you will love this recipe!

Store in airtight container 2.3 Brigadeiros – Brazilian Truffles Rachel Plouffe 2.3.1 Pitch This is classic Brazilian recipe that you see in every kid’s birthday party. This year with all the craziness that is happening, my daughter and I have been baking something every week and delivering to the neighbors as a way to stay connected and hoping it will bring a little sweetness to their lives. This recipe has been their favorite so far. It is easy to make and kids can help with the sprinkles. There is also tons of variations you can find online. 2.3.2 Materials 1 tablespoon butter 1 can sweetened condensed milk ¼ cup cocoa powder 1 ½ cups chocolate sprinkle, as needed makes about 20 servings 2.3.3 Methods In pot over low heat add sweetened condensed milk, butter and sifted cocoa powder (sifting helps prevent lumps of cocoa powder). Stir continuously (very important as mixture starts getting thicker) until you can tilt the pot and the mixture does not stick to it (or when you can see the bottom of the pot for about 3 seconds after dragging a spatula through). Pour mixture onto a greased plate and let it cool. Divide the mixture into 4 and using butter to grease your hands, shape the mixture into balls (each quarter of the mixture should make about 5 balls) Roll the balls in chocolate sprinkles Enjoy! "]]
