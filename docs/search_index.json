"],["yummy-butternut-squash-pumpkin-soup.html", "2.1 Yummy Butternut Squash &amp; Pumpkin Soup", " 2.1 Yummy Butternut Squash &amp; Pumpkin Soup Sara Helms Cahan 2.1.1 Pitch We make this on cold snowy nights in the heart of winter - a savory and rich soup, a bit of pepper heat, elegant enough for dinner parties. Originally from Bill Neal’s Southern Cooking. 2.1.2 Materials 1 ½ lbs fresh peeled butternut squash or pumpkin, cubed, or 1 lb canned pumpkin 3 Tbps butter ½ cup chopped scallions, white parts only ½ cup chopped celery ½ cup chopped carrots 1 chopped garlic clove 3 cups chicken or vegetable stock 1 cup canned Italian tomatoes, chopped, with juice ¼ tsp dried red pepper flakes ¼ tsp white pepper ⅛ tsp nutmeg 2 cups half-and-half Green tops of scallions, sliced thin for garnish 2.1.3 Methods Melt the butter in a saucepan and saute the scallions, celery and carrots gently. Add the garlic, stir briefly, and add the stock, tomatoes, and squash/pumpkin. Season with red pepper flakes, white pepper, and nutmeg. Cook slowly for 1 hour. Remove from heat, let cool slightly, and puree until texture is very smooth. Before serving, add half-and-half, reheat gently. Serve with green scallion sprinkled on top. "],["uncle-moes-latkes.html", "2.2 Uncle Moe’s Latkes", " 2.2 Uncle Moe’s Latkes Matt Futia 2.2.1 Pitch They are easy to make and can store well in the freezer if you have leftovers. 2.2.2 Story These latkes (potato pancakes) are a favorite dish every Chanukah with my family. It’s been a tradition to gather together and spend a day making batch after batch to share with family and friends. The recipe originally comes from my great Uncle Moe, who passed before I was born and who’s name influenced my name – the “M” in my first name came from his name. 2.2.3 Materials 8 medium potatoes peeled and placed in water 1 lg onion, peeled and finely grated 2 eggs 1 tsp. salt ½ tsp. pepper 1 tbsp. baking powder 1 cup matzo meal or bread crumbs vegetable oil 2.2.4 Methods Grate potatoes with food processor. Mix with grated onion, add eggs, salt, pepper and baking powder. Pour into large bowl, add matzo meal and mix thoroughly. Heat oil, and drop mixture into frying pan. Turn when crisp and drain on brown paper bags. Serve alone or with apple sauce. "],["mashed-sweet-potatoes-with-pecan-streusel.html", "2.3 Mashed Sweet Potatoes with Pecan Streusel", " 2.3 Mashed Sweet Potatoes with Pecan Streusel Kristin Bishop 2.3.1 Pitch I have been making this for friends and family for nearly 20 years and in all that time I don’t think I have ever not had anyone ask me for the recipe. This one is a BIG winner. 2.3.2 Materials makes about 12 servings 10 meduim-sized tan-skinned sweet potatoes (~6 lbs), scrubbed (I go by weight) 4 bananas, unpeeled 1 cup butter, room temperature ⅓ cup honey I added some cinnamon and ground cloves 1 ½ cups pecan pieces ¾ cup packed golden brown sugar ½ cup all purpose flour 2.3.3 Methods Preheat oven to 400ºF. Pierce sweet potatoes with fork. Place on rimmed baking sheet or in roasting pan and bake until almost soft, about 40 minutes (I find that this usually takes closer to 60, but it depends on the size of the sweet potatoes). Add bananas to roasting pan alongside sweet potatoes and bake until banana skins brown, about 10 minutes. Let sweet potatoes and bananas stand at room temperature until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes (maintain oven temperature). Cut sweet potatoes in half. Scoop flesh from sweet potatoes into large bowl. Peel bananas; add to bowl. Add ½ cup butter and honey . Beat with wooden spoon until blended and fluffy. Season to taste with salt. Transfer to 8-10 cup ovenproof baking dish. Mix nuts, sugar and flour in bowl. Add ½ cup butter, mix with fingertips until coarse crumbs form (Potatoes and streusel can be made one day ahead). Cover separately; chill. Before continuing, preheat oven to 400ºF. Sprinkle streusel over potatoes. Bake until top is golden brown and potatoes are hot, about 25 minutes. "],["satay.html", "2.4 Satay", " 2.4 Satay Sumaetee (Por) Tangwancharoen 2.4.1 Pitch I made it for the department potluck last Christmas and people loved it. Some had asked me for a recipe especially for the sauce. This is a common street food in Thailand and across Southeast Asia. You can have the sauce with any other grilled meat and vegetables or even buttered toast. 2.4.2 Materials chicken, pork, beef, tempeh, or firm tofu can of coconut milk 2 tbsps of Madras curry powder salt peanuts or peanut butter Panang curry paste Massaman curry paste fish sauce (or soy sauce) tamarind paste (optional) Note on ingredients: You can buy all of them from most Asian supermarkets 2.4.3 Methods Satay grill Cut you choice of protein (chicken, pork, beef, tempeh, firm tofu) into chicken finger size Make the marinate – half a can of coconut milk, 2 table spoons of Madras curry powder, salt to taste. This is good for about a pound of meat. Marinate protein for at least 15 minutes. It’s best to cook it over a grill but oven bake is also fine. I bake at 350ºF for 30 minutes, flip the meat at 15 minutes. Dipping sauce Toast half a cup of peanuts in a pan until brown. Crush them into rough chunky paste. You can use peanut butter as a substitute 2, Fry 1 table spoon of Panang curry paste and 1 table spoon of Massaman curry paste in coconut cream over medium high heat until fragrant. If you buy coconut milk in a can, when you open the can, you can scoop the cream from the top. If you use coconut milk from a box, add a little bit of vegetable oil when you fry curry paste. Add the rest of coconut milk and half a cup of water, bring it to simmer. Add peanut paste. If you use peanut butter, just add only around 2 table spoons. Smooth peanut butter will thicken the sauce more than chunky paste. Season to taste with fish sauce (or soy sauce), sugar and tamarind paste (optional). The sauce should be salty with a touch of sweet (and sour) "],["sides-snacks.html", "3 Sides &amp; Snacks", " 3 Sides &amp; Snacks Check out these great sides &amp; snacks: Laura Caputo Newman shares her recipe for Chipotle Rosemary Roasted Nuts – a favorite holiday thank you gift for her kids’ teachers.

"],["twice-baked-potatoes.html", "3.6 Twice-Baked Potatoes", " 3.6 Twice-Baked Potatoes Emily Mikucki 3.6.1 Pitch Can’t decide between baked potatoes and mashed potatoes? Why not have both?! This recipe is in my top 5 favorite foods EVER and was a staple at my grandma’s house growing up – holiday or not! 3.6.2 Materials 4 medium-large russet potatoes (try to get equal sizes so they have equal cook times!) 2 - 3 Tbs butter (plus a little bit extra) ¼ – ½ cup milk or ½ and ½ 8oz shredded cheddar cheese (my go-to is Cabot seriously sharp) salt black pepper Hand mixer or stand mixer Oven-safe dish 3.6.3 Methods Preheat oven to 400°F Wash potatoes. Poke each potato with a fork a few times in different directions. Rub each potato with a little bit of the extra butter (this will make potato skins crispy!) Cook potatoes directly on oven rack at 400°F for approximately 50-60min depending on size. *I learned from a podcast that the perfectly cooked potato has an internal temperature of 210°F, so if you have a cooking/meat thermometer, you can use that! Important to do this next step while potatoes are still warm. So, I suggest using oven mitts to handle the hot potatoes. Once potatoes are fully cooked, slice a long oval off the top of each potato so it looks like a little lid. Use a spoon to remove all the fluffy potato goodness, being careful not to rip the potato skins. Transfer potatoes insides to a mixing bowl or stand mixer. KEEP the potato skins and lids. Add butter, milk or ½ and ½, and cheese to the potatoes and mix until a mashed potato-like consistency. (These are just estimate amounts so add or subtract to your liking!) Add salt and pepper to taste. Transfer potato mixture back to the skins giving generous amounts to each potato. Totally ok if overflowing a bit (actually might even be better…) and top back with the lid. Put filled potatoes in an oven-safe dish and cook a second time for 20-25 minutes (or until the potato mixture starts to brown around the edges). Serve warm and enjoy! My grandpa always said the skins have the most nutrients, so we would always eat the whole thing! Who doesn’t love a crispy potato skin with a little bit of butter.

"],["brigadeiros-brazilian-truffles.html", "4.2 Brigadeiros – Brazilian Truffles", " 4.2 Brigadeiros – Brazilian Truffles Rachel Plouffe 4.2.1 Pitch This is classic Brazilian recipe that you see in every kid’s birthday party. This year with all the craziness that is happening, my daughter and I have been baking something every week and delivering to the neighbors as a way to stay connected and hoping it will bring a little sweetness to their lives. This recipe has been their favorite so far. It is easy to make and kids can help with the sprinkles. There is also tons of variations you can find online. 4.2.2 Materials makes about 20 servings 1 tablespoon butter 1 can sweetened condensed milk ¼ cup cocoa powder 1 ½ cups chocolate sprinkle, as needed 4.2.3 Methods In pot over low heat add sweetened condensed milk, butter and sifted cocoa powder (sifting helps prevent lumps of cocoa powder). Stir continuously (very important as mixture starts getting thicker) until you can tilt the pot and the mixture does not stick to it (or when you can see the bottom of the pot for about 3 seconds after dragging a spatula through). Pour mixture onto a greased plate and let it cool. Divide the mixture into 4 and using butter to grease your hands, shape the mixture into balls (each quarter of the mixture should make about 5 balls). Roll the balls in chocolate sprinkles. Enjoy!

Well, let me introduce you to my favorite dessert (and soon to be yours) chocolate mousse - made straight from the box! So light. So fluffy. So chocolatey. So delecious. Guilt-free dessert – it’s mostly air! 4.4.2 Story On my twelfth birthday, when I had learned all there is to learn, a delecious cake aflame in front of me, I said my mom – respectfully, I hope – “What’s the big deal with cake? It’s clearly not the best dessert. Brownies are better. Ice cream is better. Chocolate Mousse is better. People eat cake on birthdays because that is what you do, not because it is the best dessert. What’s up with that?” My mom has never let me forget that I said that – but she has been sure to make chocolate mousse for me every major holiday since. 4.4.3 Materials Box of Chocolate Mousse Mix Likely found in your local grocery store’s pudding isle Milk Bowl Electric mixer 4.4.4 Methods Add contents of the box and one cup of milk to a bowl. Beat with the electric mixer on low until thickened. Whip at the highest spead for 3 to 5 minutes. Spoon into serving dish. Chill in the refrigerator for at least an hour. Eat! "],["nannys-amaretti-cookies.html", "4.5 Nanny’s Amaretti Cookies", " 4.5 Nanny’s Amaretti Cookies Lauren Ash 4.5.1 Pitch This is the recipe my grandma (Nanny) uses every year to make amaretti cookies. Every Christmas Eve, we normally travel to Nanny’s house to celebrate the Feast of the Seven Fishes, which is an Italian-American tradition. Amaretti are the family’s favorites and are Italian, gluten free, sweet and delicate almond cookies. This year, I asked for the recipe and will attempt them myself since we are unable to travel. I’ve attached a picture of my brother, myself, and Nanny after we helped make her amaretti cookies in 2018. 4.5.2 Materials makes about 5 dozen cookies 8 oz almond paste 4 large egg whites 1 cup super-fine granulated sugar pinch of salt 2 tsp almond extract ¼ cup confectioners’ sugar 4.5.3 Methods Preheat oven to 300ºF and line baking sheets with parchment paper. Open the can of almond paste by opening both ends and pushing the paste through to the other side or buy almond paste in a bakery (it’s much softer and easier to use). Break the almond paste into small pieces and place in the bowl of an electric mixer along with the sugar. Mix on low speed until the mixture is very fine. Add 1 egg white and continue beating until smooth; fold in flavoring. In a separate bowl, beat remaining egg whites until foamy; add salt and continue beating until stiff but not dry. (You know the whites are beaten thoroughly when you turn the bowl upside downand the whites adhere to the sides of the bowl and do not fall out). Fold the beaten egg whites into the almond paste mixture and then beat for about 3 minutes or until very light. Drop the batter by the half teaspoonful, leaving about 1 ½ inches between cookies. When all cookies are set to bake, place confectioners’ sugar into a fine sieve or flour sifter and gently shake it over the cookies so each cookie is lightly covered. Let rest for 1 ½ hours. Bake cookies in the preheated oven for 20 minutes or until golden-brown. Remove from oven and allow to cool on the cookie sheets. Gently remove cookies from parchment; if cookies stick to parchment, turn the paper over, take a damp paper towel and gently wipe the bottom of the parchment paper to loosen the cookie. Store, tightly covered, in separated layers for up to two weeks, or freeze (To freeze, place cooled cookies on cookie sheet in a single layer in freezer until hard. Then remove to a zip-lock plastic bag, layer upon layer, without the cookies sticking to one another).

This recipe reminds me of one of my best friends Erika, she used to make these in high school during the holiday season. She swore it was a secret recipe when ever she would give them to my family. It wasn’t until she left for college that she told us… It was in the Better Homes and Gardens New Cook Book we had in our kitchen the whole time! This recipe is not only delicious but it makes me smile every time I have it! 4.6.2 Materials 1 cup butter 2 1/4 cups brown sugar 1 1/4 cups of sweetened condensed milk 1 cup light-color corn syrup 1 teaspoon vanilla 4.6.3 Methods Line a baking pan with foil and butter – suggested pan size 8×8×2 inch or 9x9x2 inch. In a sauce pan melt butter over low heat. Add brown sugar, sweetened condensed milk, and corn syrup and mix well. Cook and stir over medium heat until the mixture boils. Add a candy thermometer and allow it to continue boiling at a steady rate while stirring frequently until the thermometer reaches 248°F – approximately 20 to 25 minutes. Be prepared to adjust heat as needed to reach the 248°F point. Your caramel should be in a firm ball at this point. Remove the sauce pan from heat and remove the thermometer. Stir in the vanilla and quickly poor the mixture into the prepared pan. Let stand until hardened. Using a butter knife you should be able to cut the caramels into your desired size and complete them by wrapping with waxed paper! "]]
