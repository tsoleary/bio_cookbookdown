It’s been a tradition to gather together and spend a day making batch after batch to share with family and friends. The recipe originally comes from my great Uncle Moe, who passed before I was born and who’s name influenced my name – the “M” in my first name came from his name. 2.2.3 Materials 8 medium potatoes peeled and placed in water 1 lg onion, peeled and finely grated 2 eggs 1 tsp. salt ½ tsp. pepper 1 tbsp. baking powder 1 cup matzo meal or bread crumbs vegetable oil 2.2.4 Methods Grate potatoes with food processor. Mix with grated onion, add eggs, salt, pepper and baking powder. Pour into large bowl, add matzo meal and mix thoroughly. Heat oil, and drop mixture into frying pan. Turn when crisp and drain on brown paper bags. Serve alone or with apple sauce.

This one is a BIG winner. 2.3.2 Materials makes about 12 servings 10 meduim-sized tan-skinned sweet potatoes (~6 lbs), scrubbed (I go by weight) 4 bananas, unpeeled 1 cup butter, room temperature ⅓ cup honey I added some cinnamon and ground cloves 1 ½ cups pecan pieces ¾ cup packed golden brown sugar ½ cup all purpose flour 2.3.3 Methods Preheat oven to 400ºF. Pierce sweet potatoes with fork. Place on rimmed baking sheet or in roasting pan and bake until almost soft, about 40 minutes (I find that this usually takes closer to 60, but it depends on the size of the sweet potatoes). Add bananas to roasting pan alongside sweet potatoes and bake until banana skins brown, about 10 minutes. Let sweet potatoes and bananas stand at room temperature until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes (maintain oven temperature). Cut sweet potatoes in half. Scoop flesh from sweet potatoes into large bowl. Peel bananas; add to bowl. Add ½ cup butter and honey . Beat with wooden spoon until blended and fluffy. Season to taste with salt. Transfer to 8-10 cup ovenproof baking dish. Mix nuts, sugar and flour in bowl. Add ½ cup butter, mix with fingertips until coarse crumbs form (Potatoes and streusel can be made one day ahead). Cover separately; chill. Before continuing, preheat oven to 400ºF. Sprinkle streusel over potatoes. Bake until top is golden brown and potatoes are hot, about 25 minutes.

Brush a sheet pan generously with vegetable oil. Combine the cashews, walnuts, pecans, almonds, 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil, the maple syrup, brown sugar, orange juice, and chipotle powder on the sheet pan. Toss to coat the nuts evenly. Add 2 tablespoons of the rosemary and 2 teaspoons of salt and toss again. Spread the nuts in one layer. Roast the nuts for 25 minutes, stirring twice with a large metal spatula, until the nuts are glazed and golden brown. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with 2 more teaspoons of salt and the remaining 2 tablespoons of rosemary. Toss well and set aside at room temperature, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking as they cool. Taste for seasoning. Serve warm or cool completely and store in airtight containers at room temperature.

"],["brigadeiros-brazilian-truffles.html", "4.2 Brigadeiros – Brazilian Truffles", " 4.2 Brigadeiros – Brazilian Truffles Rachel Plouffe 4.2.1 Pitch This is classic Brazilian recipe that you see in every kid’s birthday party. This year with all the craziness that is happening, my daughter and I have been baking something every week and delivering to the neighbors as a way to stay connected and hoping it will bring a little sweetness to their lives. This recipe has been their favorite so far. It is easy to make and kids can help with the sprinkles. There is also tons of variations you can find online. 4.2.2 Materials makes about 20 servings 1 tablespoon butter 1 can sweetened condensed milk ¼ cup cocoa powder 1 ½ cups chocolate sprinkle, as needed 4.2.3 Methods In pot over low heat add sweetened condensed milk, butter and sifted cocoa powder (sifting helps prevent lumps of cocoa powder). Stir continuously (very important as mixture starts getting thicker) until you can tilt the pot and the mixture does not stick to it (or when you can see the bottom of the pot for about 3 seconds after dragging a spatula through). Pour mixture onto a greased plate and let it cool. Divide the mixture into 4 and using butter to grease your hands, shape the mixture into balls (each quarter of the mixture should make about 5 balls). Roll the balls in chocolate sprinkles. Enjoy!

Well, let me introduce you to my favorite dessert (and soon to be yours) chocolate mousse - made straight from the box! So light. So fluffy. So chocolatey. So delecious. Guilt-free dessert – it’s mostly air! 4.4.2 Story On my twelfth birthday, when I had learned all there is to learn, a delecious cake aflame infront of me, I said my mom – respectfully, I hope – “What’s the big deal with cake? It’s clearly not the best dessert. Brownies are better. Ice cream is better. Chocolate Mousse is better. People eat cake on birthdays because that is what you do, not because it is the best dessert. What’s up with that?” My mom has never let me forget that I said that – but she has been sure to make chocolate mousse for me every major holiday since. 4.4.3 Materials Box of Chocolate Mousse Mix Likely found in your local grocery store’s pudding isle Milk Bowl Electric mixer 4.4.4 Methods Add contents of the box and one cup of milk to a bowl. Beat with the electric mixer on low until thickened. Whip at the highest spead for 3 to 5 minutes. Spoon into serving dish. Chill in the refrigerator for at least an hour. Eat! "],["nannys-amaretti-cookies.html", "4.5 Nanny’s Amaretti Cookies", " 4.5 Nanny’s Amaretti Cookies Lauren Ash 4.5.1 Pitch This is the recipe my grandma (Nanny) uses every year to make amaretti cookies. Every Christmas Eve, we normally travel to Nanny’s house to celebrate the Feast of the Seven Fishes, which is an Italian-American tradition. Amaretti are the family’s favorites and are Italian, gluten free, sweet and delicate almond cookies. This year, I asked for the recipe and will attempt them myself since we are unable to travel. I’ve attached a picture of my brother, myself, and Nanny after we helped make her amaretti cookies in 2018. 4.5.2 Materials makes about 5 dozen cookies 8 oz almond paste 4 large egg whites 1 cup super-fine granulated sugar pinch of salt 2 tsp almond extract ¼ cup confectioners’ sugar 4.5.3 Methods Preheat oven to 300ºF and line baking sheets with parchment paper. Open the can of almond paste by opening both ends and pushing the paste through to the other side or buy almond paste in a bakery (it’s much softer and easier to use). Break the almond paste into small pieces and place in the bowl of an electric mixer along with the sugar. Mix on low speed until the mixture is very fine. Add 1 egg white and continue beating until smooth; fold in flavoring. In a separate bowl, beat remaining egg whites until foamy; add salt and continue beating until stiff but not dry. (You know the whites are beaten thoroughly when you turn the bowl upside downand the whites adhere to the sides of the bowl and do not fall out). Fold the beaten egg whites into the almond paste mixture and then beat for about 3 minutes or until very light. Drop the batter by the half teaspoonful, leaving about 1 ½ inches between cookies. When all cookies are set to bake, place confectioners’ sugar into a fine sieve or flour sifter and gently shake it over the cookies so each cookie is lightly covered. Let rest for 1 ½ hours. Bake cookies in the preheated oven for 20 minutes or until golden-brown. Remove from oven and allow to cool on the cookie sheets. Gently remove cookies from parchment; if cookies stick to parchment, turn the paper over, take a damp paper towel and gently wipe the bottom of the parchment paper to loosen the cookie. Store, tightly covered, in separated layers for up to two weeks, or freeze (To freeze, place cooled cookies on cookie sheet in a single layer in freezer until hard. Then remove to a zip-lock plastic bag, layer upon layer, without the cookies sticking to one another). "]]
