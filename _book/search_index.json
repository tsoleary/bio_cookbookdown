Brush a sheet pan generously with vegetable oil. Combine the cashews, walnuts, pecans, almonds, 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil, the maple syrup, brown sugar, orange juice, and chipotle powder on the sheet pan. Toss to coat the nuts evenly. Add 2 tablespoons of the rosemary and 2 teaspoons of salt and toss again. Spread the nuts in one layer. Roast the nuts for 25 minutes, stirring twice with a large metal spatula, until the nuts are glazed and golden brown. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with 2 more teaspoons of salt and the remaining 2 tablespoons of rosemary. Toss well and set aside at room temperature, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking as they cool. Taste for seasoning. Serve warm or cool completely and store in airtight containers at room temperature.

"],["twice-baked-potatoes.html", "3.3 Twice-Baked Potatoes", " 3.3 Twice-Baked Potatoes Emily Mikucki 3.3.1 Pitch Can’t decide between baked potatoes and mashed potatoes? Why not have both?! This recipe is in my top 5 favorite foods EVER and was a staple at my grandma’s house growing up – holiday or not! 3.3.2 Materials 4 medium-large russet potatoes (try to get equal sizes so they have equal cook times!) 2 - 3 Tbs butter (plus a little bit extra) ¼ – ½ cup milk or ½ and ½ 8oz shredded cheddar cheese (my go-to is Cabot seriously sharp) salt black pepper Hand mixer or stand mixer Oven-safe dish 3.3.3 Methods Preheat oven to 400°F Wash potatoes. Poke each potato with a fork a few times in different directions. Rub each potato with a little bit of the extra butter (this will make potato skins crispy!) Cook potatoes directly on oven rack at 400°F for approximately 50-60min depending on size. *I learned from a podcast that the perfectly cooked potato has an internal temperature of 210°F, so if you have a cooking/meat thermometer, you can use that! Important to do this next step while potatoes are still warm. So, I suggest using oven mitts to handle the hot potatoes. Once potatoes are fully cooked, slice a long oval off the top of each potato so it looks like a little lid. Use a spoon to remove all the fluffy potato goodness, being careful not to rip the potato skins. Transfer potatoes insides to a mixing bowl or stand mixer. KEEP the potato skins and lids. Add butter, milk or ½ and ½, and cheese to the potatoes and mix until a mashed potato-like consistency. (These are just estimate amounts so add or subtract to your liking!) Add salt and pepper to taste. Transfer potato mixture back to the skins giving generous amounts to each potato. Totally ok if overflowing a bit (actually might even be better…) and top back with the lid. Put filled potatoes in an oven-safe dish and cook a second time for 20-25 minutes (or until the potato mixture starts to brown around the edges). Serve warm and enjoy! My grandpa always said the skins have the most nutrients, so we would always eat the whole thing! Who doesn’t love a crispy potato skin with a little bit of butter.
