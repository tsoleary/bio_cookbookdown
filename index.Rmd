# Introduction

## Our mission

This cookbook is a compilation of The University of Vermont Biology Department's favorite holiday recipes.

One of the best parts of the holiday season is often sitting around a table, enjoying food together, and sharing the personal stories that are behind each recipe. This year we canâ€™t come together in person, but we can still share those stories, and hopefully spread some holiday cheer in the form of _good food_! 

We hope this cookbook is an opportunity for us to get to know each other a little better. It is a place where we can share the meaningful stories behind our favorite recipes, and try delicious new recipes.

You may submit new recipes on [this google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdHOm3Liu3LtlvbZvr9YFWXiYRM_SHFl1M4b22EPs0DGhbhYw/viewform?usp=sf_link).
