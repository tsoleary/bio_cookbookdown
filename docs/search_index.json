University of Vermont Biology Department December 14, 2020 1 Introduction 1.1 Our mission This cookbook is a compilation of The University of Vermont Biology Department’s favorite holiday recipes. One of the best parts of the holiday season is often sitting around a table, enjoying food together, and sharing the personal stories that are behind each recipe. This year we can’t come together in person, but we can still share those stories, and hopefully spread some holiday cheer in the form of good food! We hope this cookbook is an opportunity for us to get to know each other a little better. It is a place where we can share the meaningful stories behind our favorite recipes, and try delicious new recipes.

Well, let me introduce you to my favorite dessert (and soon to be yours) chocolate mousse - made straight from the box! So light. So fluffy. So chocolatey. So delecious. Guilt-free dessert – it’s mostly air! 2.1.3 Story On my twelfth birthday, when I had learned all there is to learn, a delecious cake aflame infront of me, I said my mom – respectfully I hope – “What’s the big deal with cake? It’s clearly not the best dessert. Brownies are better. Ice cream is better. Chocolate Mousse is better. People eat cake on birthdays because that is what you do, not because it is the best dessert. What’s up with that?” My mom has never let me forget that I said this – but she has been sure to make chocolate mousse for me every major holiday since. 2.1.4 Materials Box of Chocolate Mousse Mix Likely found in your local grocery store’s pudding isle Milk Bowl Electric mixer 2.1.5 Methods Add contents of the box and one cup of milk to a bowl Beat with the electric mixer on low until thickened Whip at the highest spead for 3 to 5 minutes Spoon into serving dish Chill in the refridgerator for at least an hour EAT!
