It’s been a tradition to gather together and spend a day making batch after batch to share with family and friends. The recipe originally comes from my great Uncle Moe, who passed before I was born and who’s name influenced my name – the “M” in my first name came from his name. 2.2.3 Materials 8 medium potatoes peeled and placed in water 1 lg onion, peeled and finely grated 2 eggs 1 tsp. salt ½ tsp. pepper 1 tbsp. baking powder 1 cup matzo meal or bread crumbs vegetable oil 2.2.4 Methods Grate potatoes with food processor. Mix with grated onion, add eggs, salt, pepper and baking powder. Pour into large bowl, add matzo meal and mix thoroughly. Heat oil, and drop mixture into frying pan. Turn when crisp and drain on brown paper bags. Serve alone or with apple sauce. "],["mashed-sweet-potatoes-with-pecan-streusel.html", "2.3 Mashed Sweet Potatoes with Pecan Streusel", " 2.3 Mashed Sweet Potatoes with Pecan Streusel Kristin Bishop 2.3.1 Pitch I have been making this for friends and family for nearly 20 years and in all that time I don’t think I have ever not had anyone ask me for the recipe. This one is a BIG winner. 2.3.2 Materials makes about 12 servings 10 meduim-sized tan-skinned sweet potatoes (~6 lbs), scrubbed (I go by weight) 4 bananas, unpeeled 1 cup butter, room temperature ⅓ cup honey I added some cinnamon and ground cloves 1 ½ cups pecan pieces ¾ cup packed golden brown sugar ½ cup all purpose flour 2.3.3 Methods Preheat oven to 400ºF. Pierce sweet potatoes with fork. Place on rimmed baking sheet or in roasting pan and bake until almost soft, about 40 minutes (I find that this usually takes closer to 60, but it depends on the size of the sweet potatoes). Add bananas to roasting pan alongside sweet potatoes and bake until banana skins brown, about 10 minutes. Let sweet potatoes and bananas stand at room temperature until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes (maintain oven temperature). Cut sweet potatoes in half. Scoop flesh from sweet potatoes into large bowl. Peel bananas; add to bowl. Add ½ cup butter and honey . Beat with wooden spoon until blended and fluffy. Season to taste with salt. Transfer to 8-10 cup ovenproof baking dish. Mix nuts, sugar and flour in bowl. Add ½ cup butter, mix with fingertips until coarse crumbs form (Potatoes and streusel can be made one day ahead). Cover separately; chill. Before continuing, preheat oven to 400ºF. Sprinkle streusel over potatoes. Bake until top is golden brown and potatoes are hot, about 25 minutes. "],["satay.html", "2.4 Satay", " 2.4 Satay Sumaetee (Por) Tangwancharoen 2.4.1 Pitch I made it for the department potluck last Christmas and people loved it. Some had asked me for a recipe especially for the sauce. This is a common street food in Thailand and across Southeast Asia. You can have the sauce with any other grilled meat and vegetables or even buttered toast. 2.4.2 Materials chicken, pork, beef, tempeh, or firm tofu can of coconut milk 2 tbsps of Madras curry powder salt peanuts or peanut butter Panang curry paste Massaman curry paste fish sauce (or soy sauce) tamarind paste (optional) Note on ingredients: You can buy all of them from most Asian supermarkets 2.4.3 Methods 2.4.3.1 Satay grill Cut you choice of protein (chicken, pork, beef, tempeh, firm tofu) into chicken finger size Make the marinate (half a can of coconut milk, 2 table spoons of Madras curry powder, salt to taste: this is good for about a pound of meat) Marinate protein for at least 15 minutes It’s best to cook it over a grill but oven bake is also fine. I bake at 350 F for 30 minutes, flip the meat at 15 minutes. 2.4.3.2 Dipping sauce Toast half a cup of peanuts in a pan until brown. Crush them into rough chunky paste. You can use peanut butter as a substitute Fry 1 table spoon of Panang curry paste and 1 table spoon of Massaman curry paste in coconut cream over medium high heat until fragrant. If you buy coconut milk in a can, when you open the can, you can scoop the cream from the top. If you use coconut milk from a box, add a little bit of vegetable oil when you fry curry paste. Add the rest of coconut milk and half a cup of water, bring it to simmer. Add peanut paste. If you use peanut butter, just add only around 2 table spoons. Smooth peanut butter will thicken the sauce more than chunky paste. Season to taste with fish sauce (or soy sauce), sugar and tamarind paste (optional). The sauce should be salty with a touch of sweet (and sour) "]]
